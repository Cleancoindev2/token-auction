Wishlist for rewrite:

- only one beneficiary (do this crazy logic in a separate contract)
- reduced number of auction types
- separate forward / reverse logic entirely
    - can we use delegatecall to switch logic in two-way
- collapse into single contract (remove frontend / db split)
- use up to date dappsys (esp. ds-math)

- consider single token pair per contract
